As of 0.3.1, ACMI supports aircraft skins, radio portraits, weapon skins, crosshairs, canopies, cockpits and visual effects.</p><div class="block note">Many mod installers support the Mod Installer/FOMOD standard, but it's my understanding that Vortex is the only one to support AC7</div></div></section><section class=page id=install-usage><h1><a href=#install-usage>Installation and Usage</a></h1><div class=content><p>If your mods are in your current directory, just run <code>acmi.exe build</code> to build the installer files, or you can pass a specific directory like <code>acmi.exe build D:/Mods/MyAwesomeSkinPack</code> if it&rsquo;s not in the current directory. You can also just drag-and-drop your mod folder onto the <code>acmi.exe</code> file (see the Walkthrough below) to immediately build installer files for that directory.</p><p>If it completes successfully, you should see a new <code>fomod</code> directory in your mod files. Just include that folder when you ZIP up your archive (to upload to Nexus/ModDB/wherever) then anyone who installs your archive with a mod manager will get the nice guided installer. Users who want to install manually can just ignore the fomod folder and it will not affect your other files in any way.</p><div class="block note">You can also just run <code>acmi.exe --help</code> to see some basic help and usage info</div></div></section><section class=page id=usage-extras><h1><a href=#usage-extras>Extras/Advanced</a></h1><div class=content></div></section><section class=page id=usage-images><h1><a href=#usage-images>Images</a></h1><div class=content><p>We&rsquo;ll try our best to find a suitable image for the installer as a whole. This will be shown on the first page of the installer and for any steps without their own images. If there&rsquo;s only one <code>.png</code>/<code>.jpg</code> in the root folder, we&rsquo;ll use that. If there&rsquo;s more than one, we&rsquo;ll use the first one we find with &ldquo;preview&rdquo; in the name.</p><p>You can also have images for your individual skin files! Just include a <code>.png</code> or <code>.jpg</code> with the <em>same name</em> as the <code>.pak</code> file, beside it. For example, for a file at <code>Skins\UntoldGalmPack_F15C_F15ACipher1994_MageSlot.pak</code>, we would check for a <code>Skins\UntoldGalmPack_F15C_F15ACipher1994_MageSlot.png</code> file and use that if it&rsquo;s found.</p><p>Alternatively if your pak files are in separate folders (organised by slot or set, for example) the installer will also check if there&rsquo;s only one image in the same folder as your skin files and use that. If this causes problems for your structure, please <a href=https://github.com/agc93/acmi/issues>raise an issue</a> and I&rsquo;ll try and come up with a better solution.</p></div></section><section class=page id=usage-merged><h1><a href=#usage-merged>Multi-Skin Files</a></h1><div class=content><p>If your mod directory includes <code>.pak</code> files with more than one skin in them (such as merged NPC files), include the exact string <code>MULTI</code> anywhere in the file name. This tells ACMI to scan a much larger chunk of the file to find skins and include <em>any</em> it finds, not just the first one.</p><div class="block warn">This can slow down the build process quite a bit if you have lots of large merged files, but your installer will be misleading if you don't.</div><p>For example, <code>F15SMTD_Monarch_Skin1_P.pak</code> will only get scanned for one, but <code>Flashy_NPC_Aircraft_MULTI_P.pak</code> would get scanned for <em>any</em> skins and included in a separate step of the final installer. This <em>should</em> work with any <code>pak</code> file up to about 2.5GB, but <a href=https://github.com/agc93/acmi/issues>let me know</a> if it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p></div></section><section class=page id=usage-special><h1><a href=#usage-special>Special Files</a></h1><div class=content><p>There&rsquo;s a couple of things you can also do to tweak how ACMI picks up your files and includes them in an installer.</p><h3 id=lightweight-packing>Lightweight Packing</h3><p>If the mod has been packed using Cherry&rsquo;s &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; packing method, the individual slot files will have nothing but an instance file in them so ACMI won&rsquo;t detect them as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; skin file. If you include <code>(LIGHT)</code> or <code>(LW)</code> somewhere in the file name, ACMI will instead detect those instance files and sort them into planes and slots correctly.</p><p>Likewise, if you add <code>(REQ)</code> or <code>(REQD)</code> in your &ldquo;base package&rdquo; file, it should be identified as a required file and users will not be able to toggle the file off during installation.</p><div class="block tip">You can use any of `[`,`(` or `_` to surround the special keywords. So all of `(LIGHT)`, `[LW]` and `_REQD_` would all be correctly identified.</div></div></section><section class=page id=faq><h1><a href=#faq>FAQ</a></h1><div class=content><p>Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions about ACMI.</p><h3 id=who-is-acmi-for>Who is ACMI for?</h3><p><strong>Modders</strong>. More specifically, it&rsquo;s for whoever is <em>packing</em> mod archives. Before you actually ZIP up the mod files, just run <code>acmi build</code>, answer the prompts, and the files will be generated for you (in their own <code>fomod</code> folder).</p><div class="block warn">At present, <strong>do not</strong> use this with model mods! It will detect model swaps as a skin file and group it with everything else. This will hopefully be fixable, but it will be fine for skins for custom models.</div><h3 id=why-should-i-use-this>Why should I use this?</h3><p>I get it. You&rsquo;ve got a workflow that works for you and don&rsquo;t want to learn a new thing. That&rsquo;s why ACMI is designed to be as easy-to-use as possible!</p><p>In my opinion, there&rsquo;s two good reasons why: <strong>drastically</strong> better user experience and less bug reports. For the <em>thousands</em> of Vortex users with Ace Combat, installing mods without installers is pretty unintuitive. Installing mods with ACMI files is trivial and doesn&rsquo;t require an innate understanding of how modding works. It&rsquo;s really a whole different level of easy to install, for everything from simple skin mods to complex packs.</p><p>The advantage for you is less reports. When a Vortex user installs your mod without any installers, the <em>default</em> action will almost certainly not install correctly. Users will have to take a wild guess at which files they need, which is where problems can arise. With ACMI files, the installer handles all of that for them and shows a convenient wizard that avoids the installation errors you might otherwise get.</p><h3 id=how-does-it-work>How does it work?</h3><p>The short version is that ACMI will scan through the mod root (defaults to the current directory) and find <em>any</em> <code>.pak</code> files then check for the actual object path in the file headers (something like <code>/Game/f15c_06_D</code>) and use that to guess what aircraft and slot it&rsquo;s for. Next, we build a big list of all the skins in all the files, group them by aircraft and skin slot and then build the XML that mod installers will use to provide choices to the user.</p><h3 id=what-file-types-does-it-support>What file types does it support?</h3><p>At current, ACMI will fully detect and specifically handle skins, radio portraits, weapons, crosshairs, cockpits, canopies and visual effects. Any PAK files that can&rsquo;t be detected properly will still be included in the installer files in a separate &ldquo;Extra Files&rdquo; step.</p><h3 id=what-happens-to-my-lovingly-crafted-readme-files>What happens to my lovingly crafted README files?</h3><p>If you have any README files that you want to be installed, make sure they&rsquo;re in the <strong>root</strong> of the mod files, not in a folder of their own. If you do that, no matter what choices someone makes in the installer, your README file will still be installed with all its veiled threats and shitpost-y lore details</p><h3 id=will-it-affect-other-users>Will it affect other users?</h3><p>In short, no. When a user goes to install your mod manually, they&rsquo;ll unzip the archive and the only impact is that there will be an extra <code>fomod</code> folder in the unpacked files. There&rsquo;s only two XML files in there, so it won&rsquo;t even break things if users accidentally &ldquo;install&rdquo; that folder, so it shouldn&rsquo;t cause any impact for users.</p><h3 id=does-it-affect-my-mod-files>Does it affect my mod files?</h3><p><strong>No.</strong> We don&rsquo;t make any changes to the <code>.pak</code> files the ACMI finds (I wouldn&rsquo;t even know how), and instead we just read some strings out of the file headers to determine aircraft, skin, etc</p></div></section><section class=page id=example><h1><a href=#example>Walkthrough</a></h1><div class=content><p>For an example of how to use this, we&rsquo;re going to build installer files for a chonker of a skin pack: the excellent Skies Untold Historic Warlock Pack by njmksr.</p><h3 id=getting-started>Getting Started</h3><p>First, we&rsquo;re going to assume you&rsquo;ve unpacked the <code>acmi.exe</code> to somewhere convenient.
