The same release archive will include both ACMI (acmi.exe) and ACMI Packer (acmi-pack.exe).
ACMI won't update itself at this time. Make sure to check [releases](https://github.com/agc93/acmi/releases) regularly for new updates.</description></item><item><title>Usage</title><link>/packer/usage/usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/packer/usage/usage/</guid><description>In short, the easiest way to build your PAK files is to drag-and-drop the folder containing all your cooked files onto acmi-pack.exe.
Preparing your cooked files Once you have your cooked files (should be a set of files like fa27_05_D.uasset and so forth), drop them into an empty folder.
Aircraft skin files (including diffuses, instance files and MREC files) can simply be left as-is, they don&amp;rsquo;t need to be put into their own folder structure.</description></item><item><title>Required Paths</title><link>/packer/usage/paths/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/packer/usage/paths/</guid><description>The advantage to using ACMI&amp;rsquo;s detection logic is that you often won&amp;rsquo;t need to recreate the whole Nimbus/... folder structure to pack your files: it will do that automatically. However, because PA can&amp;rsquo;t name shit to save their lives, some file types still need at least some of the path to be recreated to pack properly.
