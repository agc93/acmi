ACMI won't update itself at this time. Make sure to check [releases](https://github.com/agc93/acmi/releases) regularly for new updates.</description></item><item><title>Usage</title><link>/usage/usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/usage/usage/</guid><description>If your mods are in your current directory, just run acmi.exe build to build the installer files, or you can pass a specific directory like acmi.exe build D:/Mods/MyAwesomeSkinPack if it&amp;rsquo;s not in the current directory. You can also just drag-and-drop your mod folder onto the acmi.exe file (see the Walkthrough below) to immediately build installer files for that directory.
If it completes successfully, you should see a new fomod directory in your mod files.</description></item></channel></rss>
