This will be shown on the first page of the installer and for any steps without their own images. If there&amp;rsquo;s only one .png/.jpg in the root folder, we&amp;rsquo;ll use that. If there&amp;rsquo;s more than one, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the first one we find with &amp;ldquo;preview&amp;rdquo; in the name.
You can also have images for your individual skin files!</description></item><item><title>Multi-Skin Files</title><link>/extras/merged/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/extras/merged/</guid><description>If your mod directory includes .pak files with more than one skin in them (such as merged NPC files), include the exact string MULTI anywhere in the file name. This tells ACMI to scan a much larger chunk of the file to find skins and include any it finds, not just the first one.
This can slow down the build process quite a bit if you have lots of large merged files, but your installer will be misleading if you don't.</description></item></channel></rss>
