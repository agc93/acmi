ACMI is a simple command-line app that will automatically generate the XML files required for mod installers (like Vortex) to show a nice guided installer rather than users having to pick the right skin files on their own.

Including these files will simplify installing skin packs when using compatible mod installers, showing users which files will affect which aircraft and which slot and interactively prompting them for which files to install.

Many mod installers support the Mod Installer/FOMOD standard, but it's my understanding that Vortex is the only one to support AC7
