This is just a community-backed [open-source](https://github.com/agc93/acmi) project, not an officially-supported modding tool. As such, support is best-effort.

To report a problem or request a new feature, create a new issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/agc93/acmi/issues) and provide as much detail as possible. You can usually find me on the Ace Combat Discord as well.
