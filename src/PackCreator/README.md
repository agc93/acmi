# ACMI Packer/`acmi-pack`

ACMI Packer is an easy-to-use-but-actually-quite-complex auto-packing tool for AC7 mods.

## What is it?

First and foremost, it's what we in development circles call *highly opinionated*. That means it makes a lot of assumptions and presumptions about how things _should_ work and may be difficult to adapt from this. As such, at this time, ACMI Packer is not something I'd consider a universally applicable tool. For example, if you like merging lots of things as single PAKs, or are packing some more exotic things (emblems, for example) it might not be the tool for you.
