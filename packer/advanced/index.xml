Walkthrough: Skins Let&amp;rsquo;s take the example of two variants of a skin for the same slot: an XFA-27 skin in Slot 7. When you cooked your files, you will have produced some files that you can copy into a folder like this:
C:/Mods/XFASkin ├── Standard Version │ ├── fa27_06_D.</description></item><item><title>Normals and MRECs</title><link>/packer/advanced/mrecs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/packer/advanced/mrecs/</guid><description>When ACMI Packer starts packing your files, it will actually read any Instance files (aka *_Inst.uasset) it finds and automatically determine the paths for MRECs and Normal files. ACMI Packer will set up any extra paths (like the ex/ folder) for you depending on what the Instance file uses: just make sure the cooked asset is named right.
That means that in general, you can just dump all your cooked files and any relevant instance files in the same folder, like so:</description></item><item><title>Recooking Assets</title><link>/packer/advanced/recook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/packer/advanced/recook/</guid><description>This is highly experimental functionality! It also only supports aircraft skins. If you&amp;rsquo;ve already cooked your skin&amp;rsquo;s assets for one slot, ACMI can &amp;ldquo;recook&amp;rdquo; your files for different slots without having to duplicate and cook them all in UE4.
Once you have all your cooked assets for one slot, you should have files like the below:
C:/Mods/XFASkin ├── fa27_00_D.uasset ├── fa27_00_D.uexp ├── fa27_00_Inst.uasset ├── fa27_00_Inst.uexp ├── fa27_00_MREC.uasset └── fa27_00_MREC.uexp Next, you must put any instance files for slots you want to use in the folder as well.</description></item><item><title>Unsupported Files</title><link>/packer/advanced/unsupported/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/packer/advanced/unsupported/</guid><description>While ACMI Packer works best with skins and other ACMI-supported files (like radio portraits or canopies), it should still work just fine for other mods as well. Just create the full Nimbus/Content/.../... folder structure for your cooked file like you usually would and run the packer. It should identify the files in their folder and recreate the folder structure from the build folder in the resulting PAK file.
This is much less tested than the supported types, so please let me know if you run into problems using this method.</description></item></channel></rss>
